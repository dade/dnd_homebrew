* Realised there's currently no mention of how Anima regenerates (think it was that you gain half max on a short rest, all on a long rest)

* Manifestations/drawbacks and how to counter it

* Essence Shift - did this get dropped?

* where does Anima come from? Other people's souls that we steal pieces of? Randomly generated naturally?

* manifestation physical - as the descent into another form begins, the shadow of the soulborne visibly changes to more of the soul that is trying to take over

* maybe drawbacks include losing some control over Chromatic Soul (d6 roll - 1-3 means it randomises/fails)

* why do emotions have some much control over what the soulborne does via paths?

* clarify that you can't change a path once you've chosen it - and clarify how they build on each other (so that you know you're not locked into one emotion at every state - and that the CURRENT ruling state dictates the damage that the missiles do)
