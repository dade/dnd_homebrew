* Realised there's currently no mention of how Anima regenerates (think it was that you gain half max on a short rest, all on a long rest)

* Manifestations/drawbacks and how to counter it

* Essence Shift - did this get dropped?

* where does Anima come from? Other people's souls that we steal pieces of? Randomly generated naturally?

* manifestation physical - as the descent into another form begins, the shadow of the soulborne visibly changes to more of the soul that is trying to take over
