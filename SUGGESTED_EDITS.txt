* Manifestations/drawbacks and how to counter it

* where does Anima come from? Other people's souls that we steal pieces of? Randomly generated naturally?

* manifestation physical - as the descent into another form begins, the shadow of the soulborne visibly changes to more of the soul that is trying to take over

* maybe drawbacks include losing some control over Chromatic Soul (d6 roll - 1-3 means it randomises/fails)

* why do emotions have some much control over what the soulborne does via paths?
