          Imogen, you asked us to leave you details of our movements with Garrett. I hope this note finds you well.

          Torinn submitted our report regarding Adil, The Hammer, and began researching his artifact. Seems he's found information. Andinius told us of another group of Seekers with information to the East, so we're heading to a group of farming estates. It seems to be about a day and a half walking speed. We are leaving some time midday. Good luck with your travels alone and stay safe.
